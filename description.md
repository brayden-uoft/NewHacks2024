## **Inspiration**
Phishing attacks and IDN (Internationalized Domain Name) spoofing remain persistent threats on the web, tricking users by mimicking legitimate URLs using look-alike characters. Our project aims to enhance browsing security by proactively detecting such threats and providing users with actionable insights to stay safe.

---

## **What it does**
1. **Automatic Detection of IDN Spoofing:**
   - When users visit a potentially spoofed or suspicious site, the extension identifies IDN spoofing patterns and displays a warning page with safety recommendations.
  
2. **Manual Safety Review Trigger:**
   - Users can open the extension pop-out and manually request a real-time AI-generated safety report for the current site they are visiting.

## **How we built it**
- **Technologies Used:**
  - **JavaScript, HTML, CSS** for extension UI and logic.
  - **Google Generative AI API** to generate safety reports for manual checks.
  - **Manifest V3** to align with the latest Chrome extension standards.
  - **Punycode, Unicode and RegEx Parsing:** To detect homograph attacks and suspicious URL patterns.

- **Core Components:**
  - **Background Service Worker:** Monitors visited URLs and triggers a redirect to a safety page if a spoof is detected.
    - Leveraged a [database of Unicode character homographs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07539) generated by researchers at Waseda University using machine learning techniques to determine if URLs are "look-alikes" of trusted websites, collected by Amazon's Alexa Internet, Inc.
    - In the process, we reverse-engineered Google Chrome's Punycode conversion of Unicode characters.
  - **Popup Interface:** Allows users to manually initiate a site safety review.
  - **AI Integration:** Generates contextual safety reports based on URL structure and patterns.
    - Makes calls to Google's Generative AI API, allowing it to analyze the URL and provide a clear set of reccomendations for a user to ensure their safety on the site.

## **Challenges we ran into**
- Learning the Manifest V3 framework and the restrictions that come with it, including Chrome's service worker requirements, which changed how we managed background processes.
- Dealing with different requirements for extensions to function across multiple browsers.
- Parsing and identifying homograph links, which may be converted into different representations like Punycode.
- Dealing with delays and limited cloud resources while integrating third-party AI services into the extension.

---

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**
- Successfully detected multiple phishing URLs using a combination of Punycode parsing and AI analysis.
- Integrated a working **AI safety report** feature within the extension.
- Built a robust, simple UI within the time constraints of the hackathon.
- Created a tool that can integrate with our everyday web browsing and that we would genuinely use.

## **What we learned**
- Gained experience working with **Chrome’s Manifest V3** and its limitations.
- Improved understanding of Unicode vulnerabilities and how they are exploited for phishing attacks.
- Learned how to integrate external APIs (Google AI) efficiently into browser extensions.

## **What’s next for CarpySafe - IDN Spoofing Attack Defender**
- **Expand AI capabilities**: Include more contextual analysis, such as domain reputation and SSL status in the safety report.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Extend full support to Firefox and Safari browsers.
- **More Forms of Phishing Domain Detection**: Integrate more machine learning-based threat detection abilities, including other forms of URL spoofing detection.
- **Page Content Analysis**: Extend threat detection to scraping the content of the webpage for dangerous material, all while remaining simple and lightweight.
