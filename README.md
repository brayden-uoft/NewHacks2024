## **Download and Installation**
Chrome extensions not installed through the Chrome Web Store should be loaded as unpacked extensions. To do so, first download the repository using Github (Code -> Download Zip) or by cloning the repository with your method of choice. If you downloaded the repository as a zip, extract it, making sure to save the resulting folder in a convenient location. 

Navigate to the Chrome extensions menu by entering `chrome://extensions` in the omnibar or by clicking the three-dots menu at the top right corner -> üß© Extensions -> Manage Extensions. 

Click Load Unpacked at the top left of the page. Navigate to the directory to which the repository has been saved and confirm. If all has gone well, the extension will appear under All Extensions.

## **Usage**
Carpy will automatically scan visited domain names for possible spoofing attacks. If one is detected, it will redirect the browser away from the potentially malicious website to a dialog explaining the potential risk and red flags posed by the domain. An option to ignore the warning and proceed is provided on the page. Manually reloading the page will reset this option.

You may also generate a report on the estimated safety of any domain that you are visiting. Open the extensions menu by clicking the üß© puzzle piece icon at the top-right of the browser and locate Carpy. Select Generate Safety Report and a report on the trustworthiness of the domain will be provided. 

Example suspicious link: [–∞—Ä—Ä”è–µ.com](–∞—Ä—Ä”è–µ.com)

# **Hackathon Project Charter: Cybersecurity Chrome Extension**

---

## **Project Overview**  
Develop a Chrome extension that improves cybersecurity awareness by identifying impersonation sites and providing online safety tips.

---

## **Gap/Problem**  
- Users often fall victim to phishing through malicious URLs that mimic legitimate websites.  
- There is a need for easy-to-access tools that inform users if a site is suspicious and provide quick security advice.

---

## **Scope**  
1. **Core Features**:  
   - URL verification: Detect if the site is an impersonation.  
   - AI-backed site analysis for additional risk assessment (using a lightweight API).  
   - PSA message with essential online safety tips upon interaction with the extension.  

2. **User Interaction**:  
   - One-click interaction with the Chrome extension to scan the current page.  
   - Display result: "Safe" / "Suspicious" / "Unknown" with recommendations.

---

## **Existing Technologies to Use**  
1. **Chrome Extension API** ‚Äì Build and deploy the browser extension.  
2. **AI/ML API for Site Detection** (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Safe Browsing API).  
3. **JavaScript & HTML/CSS** ‚Äì Extension frontend.  
4. **Regular Expressions (RegEx)** ‚Äì Detect suspicious patterns in URLs.
